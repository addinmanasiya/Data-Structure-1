## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Hi there! This repository contains all my **labs** and **assignments** from **CP164 â€“ Introduction to the Study of Data Structures**.

Throughout this course, I explored how data is organized, processed, and manipulated efficiently using various structures and algorithms. Everything here was coded in **Python** as part of my journey through understanding key computing concepts.
